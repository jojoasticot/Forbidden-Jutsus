## Internet protocol stack

The Internet protocol stack, often referred to as the **TCP/IP** stack, is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of communication protocols used for internet-like networks. 

The Internet protocol stack consists of four main layers:

>[!abstract]- 1 Link Layer
> - The link layer is the lowest layer in the TCP/IP model.
> - This layer deals with the physical connection to the network and is responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium.
> - It includes protocols such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).

>[!abstract]- 2 Internet Layer
>  - The internet layer derives its name from its function facilitating internetworking.
> - It is responsible for addressing and routing packets between devices across different networks.
  > - The primary protocol at this layer is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides a unique address to each device on the network (IPv4 or IPv6).

>[!abstract]- 3 Transport Layer
> - The Transport Layer ensures end-to-end communication between devices and is responsible for error detection, correction, and flow control.
  > - Two prominent transport layer protocols are [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol). TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers a connectionless and lightweight alternative.
  > - Together, TCP and UDP comprise essentially all traffic on the Internet and are the only protocols implemented in every major operating system.

>[!abstract]- 4 Application Layer
> - The Application Layer is where user applications and network services interact with the network.
> - It includes various protocols for specific applications, such as [HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) for web browsing, [FTP (File Transfer Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) for file transfer, [SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) for email, and more.
  > - This layer represents the interface between the network and the software applications that utilize network services.

Each layer in the Internet protocol stack relies on the services provided by the layer immediately below it.

### Ports

A port is a logical endpoint for communication. They are used by every TCP/UDP communication.

 - A port is identified by a 16-bit unsigned number, resulting in a range of 0 to 65535.
 - A connection is identified by the double pair ` (IP1,port1),(IP2,port2)) `
 - Port numbers from 0 to 1023 are well-known or system ports and are reserved for specific, standardized services. For example, HTTP typically uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443.

### client side

The [getaddrinfo(3)](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/manpages-dev/getaddrinfo.3.en.html) function in C is used for resolving domain names into IP addresses and obtaining information about network services.


**getaddrinfo**() returns one or more _addrinfo_ structures, each of which contains an Internet address that can be specified in a call to [bind(2)](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/manpages-dev/bind.2.en.html) or [connect(2)](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/manpages-dev/connect.2.en.html).

>[!info]- The _addrinfo_ structure
>```c
>struct addrinfo { 
>	int ai_flags; 
>	int ai_family; 
>	int ai_socktype; 
>	int ai_protocol; 
>	socklen_t ai_addrlen; 
>	struct sockaddr *ai_addr; 
>	char *ai_canonname; 
>	struct addrinfo *ai_next; 
>};
>```

Our function will take a `char* url` as a parameter.

First we need to set up hints to filter results :
```c
// Create the 'hints' structure.
struct addrinfo hints;

// Initialize all the fields to zero.
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));

// Specify the criteria
hints.ai_family = AF_INET;       // IPv4
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP
```

>[!info]- Differents criterias
>Here are some examples of other possible criterias
> 1) **ai_family**
>AF_INET: IPv4 only 
>AF_INET6: IPv6 only
>AF_UNSPEC: Either IPv4 or IPv6
>2) **ai_socktype**
>SOCK_STREAM: TCP
>SOCK_DGRAM: UDP
>0: Either TCP or UDP

We parse the url (separate the host and the path)

```c
char* host;
char* path;

parse_url(url,&host,&path);
```

Now we will try to obtain the necessary network information calling `getaddrinfo`.

```c
struct addrinfo *result;
int status = getaddrinfo(host, "80", &hints, &result);

if (status != 0)
{
	printf("error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

For each `addrinfo` in the results we try establish a connection :

```c
int sock;
struct addrinfo *p;
for (p = result; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next) {
	sock = socket(p->ai_family,p->ai_socktype,p->ai_protocol);
	if (sock == -1){
		continue;
	}
	int connection = connect(sock,p->ai_addr,p->ai_addrlen);
	if (connection == -1){
		close(sock);
	} else {
		//If the connection is successful we stop the loop to keep 
		//the file descriptor of the socket
		break;	
	}
}
```

If `p` is `NULL` it means that no connection was established, otherwise we can write our request to the socket. 

```c
if (p == NULL){
	errx(1,"print_page: no connection established");
}

// writes the request in the socket
write_request(sock,host,path);

// we can free the list of adress now
freeaddrinfo(result);
```

Now we can give back to the STDOUT the answer from the server :

```c
int r;
while ((r = read(sock,buffer,BUFFER_SIZE)) > 0){
	write(STDOUT_FILENO,buffer,r);
};
```

Note that the following line both sets a value to r and returns it
```c
(r = read(sock,buffer,BUFFER_SIZE)) > 0
```

We must not foget to close the file descriptor of the socket and free the array used.

```c
close(sock);
free(path);
free(host);
```
