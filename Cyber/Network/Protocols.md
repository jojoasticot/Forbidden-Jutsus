### Cisco 

Cisco lets you hash password with a method called Cisco7 and it looks like this :

```
username hub password 7 025017705B3907344E 
username admin privilege 15 password 7 10181A325528130F010D24
username guest password 7 124F163C42340B112F3830
```

It is called a Cisco7 hash and is easily breakable with tools such as [this website](https://www.frameip.com/decrypter-dechiffrer-cracker-password-cisco-7/)

### TTL 

In the TCP/IP protocol, TTL can mean Time To Live and it specifies the maximum time a packet is allowed to live or the maximum number of hops it can take in a network before being discarded.

Bruteforce 

<1755.1.5f403625.BcWGgpKzUPRC8vscWn0wuA==@vps-7e2f5a72>

followed by a secret. 

The expected hash is :
