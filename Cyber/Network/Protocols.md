### Cisco 

Cisco lets you hash password with a method called Cisco7 and it looks like this :

```
username hub password 7 025017705B3907344E 
username admin privilege 15 password 7 10181A325528130F010D24
username guest password 7 124F163C42340B112F3830
```

It is called a Cisco7 hash and is easily breakable with tools such as [this website](https://www.frameip.com/decrypter-dechiffrer-cracker-password-cisco-7/)
